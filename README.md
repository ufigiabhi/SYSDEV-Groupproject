Your dashboard should be able to read files of data in CSV format, to process them and display
the outcomes graphically.
• Identify the top three selling foods and the top three selling coffees and display the sales
fluctuation over a period of four weeks, in graphical format.
• Select suitable algorithms (any AI & Machine Learning) and apply them to predict the
sales of the selected products over the next four weeks.
• Display the predicted sales of each item in a separate graphical representation.
• Allow the user to focus on a selected period (a few days) to zoom and view the detail of
the predictions.
• Allow the user to change the training period and explore predictions with different
lengths of training data (between 4 to 8 weeks) and compare the results. In each case
the system should offer the option to provide tabular and graphical format of the
predicted sales.
